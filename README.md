# AdaptingVQAtoPronounRes

Welcome to our repo! This is our attempt that the Winograd Schema Challenge. 

We ask that you read through our paper on our work; it describes most of what we are doing.

In this repo are our scripts for generating data to be embedded (*generator.py), the CSVs that we have fed into our embeddings, the datasets, and our models.

Feel free to run any of them to verify; we used Python3 for this project, so it is required. Simply clone our repo and run any of our scripts. All the data should be in the correct spot for referencing.
