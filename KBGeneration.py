#NOTES:
#This script generates question from the UT-Dallas Dataset.
#It makes line specific adjustments to generate the correct data; it will NOT work on general datasets
#Given a sentence, it will generate two questions:
#--------------"What does <pronoun> refer to?"
#--------------"What <clause>?"
#--------------FOR EXAMPLE: "The bee landed on the flower because it had pollen."
#--------------"What does it refer to?"
#--------------"What had pollen?"
#These question will be output to a text file, with each question on a seperate line.
#No white space between question pairs.
